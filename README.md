# About Robert Babiak
I am a Software Engineer with fifteen years of experince, and I have no idea how to make this sound not like bragging. My first job was writting Airline 
ticketing software for Greyhound Air. Then I moved onto working on a industrial P.L.C. controller application called FrameWorks for GE-Fanuc. After this 
I moved into the game development industry when I started with Bioware. My first game credit was Never Winter Nights. Knight of the Old Republic on the 
original x-box was my second game. The last game I worked on for Bioware was Mass effect 1. This marked a big chnage im my life when I moved to Iceland.
to work for CCP hf on Eve-Online. This was the first MMO that had worked on and also marked my introduction to Python programming, specificly the Stackless
variation. This is a language and development enviroment that I have fallen in love with.
